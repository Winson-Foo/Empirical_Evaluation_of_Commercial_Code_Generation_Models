 */
public interface OptionalArguments {
    // this interface doesn't have any methods or variables
    // as it only acts as a marker interface
} 

// Changes made:
// - Added proper documentation for the file and the interface.
// - Removed the specific term "two", as it is not needed.
// - Renamed the interface from "TwoOptionalArguments" to "OptionalArguments", 
//   as the naming conventions dictate that the interface name should be a 
//   noun descriptive of its behavior.
// - Changed the access modifier from default to public, to ensure that the 
//   interface can be used outside of its package.
// - Added a newline at the end of the file to ensure consistency with 
//   industry standards.
