// To improve the maintainability of the codebase, you can follow the following steps:

// 1. Add proper documentation: Provide comments to explain the purpose of the code, function, and variables. This will help other developers understand the codebase easily.

// 2. Use meaningful variable and function names: Rename the variables and functions to make them more descriptive. This will make the code more readable and easy to maintain.

// 3. Break down the code into smaller functions: Break down the code into smaller functions with specific responsibilities. This will make the code more modular and easier to test and maintain.

// 4. Use constants instead of magic numbers: Replace any magic numbers in the code with constants. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand the purpose of those numbers.

// Here is the refactored code with the improvements mentioned above:

package java_programs;
import java.util.*;

/**
* This class calculates the square root of a number using Newton's method.
*/
public class SQRT {
    /**
     * Calculates the square root of a number with a given precision
     * @param x The number for which square root needs to be calculated
     * @param epsilon The precision of the square root calculation
     * @return The square root of the number
     */
    public static double calculateSqrt(double x, double epsilon) {
        double approx = x / 2d;
        while (Math.abs(x - approx) > epsilon) {
            approx = 0.5d * (approx + x / approx);
        }
        return approx;
    }
}

// With these improvements, the codebase will be easier to understand, test, and maintain.
