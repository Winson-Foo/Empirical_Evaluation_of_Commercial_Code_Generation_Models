// To improve the maintainability of the given codebase, we can make the following changes:

// 1. Add comments: Add comments to explain the purpose of the code, the parameters, and the return value of the to_base() method.

// 2. Improve variable names: Change variable names to be more descriptive and meaningful. For example, "num" can be changed to "number", "b" can be changed to "base", and "i" can be changed to "remainder".

// 3. Use a StringBuilder for concatenation: Instead of concatenating strings using the "+" operator, we can use a StringBuilder to improve performance.

// Here is the refactored code:

package java_programs;

import java.util.*;

/**
 * This class provides a method to convert a number to a given base.
 */
public class BaseConverter {
    /**
     * Convert the given number to the given base.
     *
     * @param number the number to be converted
     * @param base   the base to convert the number to
     * @return the converted number as a string
     */
    public static String to_base(int number, int base) {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        String alphabet = "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
        int remainder;
        
        while (number > 0) {
            remainder = number % base;
            number = number / base; // floor division?
            result.insert(0, alphabet.charAt(remainder));
        }

        return result.toString();
    }
}

// By adding comments, using descriptive variable names, and using a StringBuilder for concatenation, the code becomes more readable and maintainable.
