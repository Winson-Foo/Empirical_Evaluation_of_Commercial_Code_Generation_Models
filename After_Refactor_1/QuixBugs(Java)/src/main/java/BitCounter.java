// To improve the maintainability of the codebase, you can make the following changes:
// 1. Add comments to explain the purpose of the code and its functionality.
// 2. Use proper variable names to make the code more self-explanatory.
// 3. Use a more descriptive and meaningful class name.
// 4. Encapsulate the bit counting logic into a separate method for better modularity.

// Here's the refactored code:

package java_programs;

/**
 * This class provides methods for counting the number of set bits in an integer.
 */
public class BitCounter {

    /**
     * Counts the number of set bits in the given integer.
     * @param n the integer to count the set bits in
     * @return the number of set bits in the given integer
     */
    public static int countSetBits(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n != 0) {
            n = n ^ (n - 1);
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
