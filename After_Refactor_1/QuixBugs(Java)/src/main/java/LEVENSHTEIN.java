// To improve the maintainability of the codebase, we can start by organizing the code and adding documentation to improve readability. Additionally, we can optimize the code by storing the results of previously computed subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

// Here is the refactored code:

// ```java
package correct_java_programs;

import java.util.*;

/**
 * The LEVENSHTEIN class calculates the Levenshtein distance between two strings.
 * The Levenshtein distance is a metric for measuring the difference between two strings.

        }
      
        if (n == 0) {
            return m;
        }
      
        if (memo[m][n] != 0) {
            return memo[m][n];
        }
      
        if (source.charAt(m - 1) == target.charAt(n - 1)) {
            memo[m][n] = levenshteinHelper(source.substring(0, m - 1), target.substring(0, n - 1), memo);
            return memo[m][n];
        }
      
        int insertion = levenshteinHelper(source, target.substring(0, n - 1), memo) + 1;
        int deletion = levenshteinHelper(source.substring(0, m - 1), target, memo) + 1;
        int substitution = levenshteinHelper(source.substring(0, m - 1), target.substring(0, n - 1), memo) + 1;
        memo[m][n] = Math.min(insertion, Math.min(deletion, substitution));
      
        return memo[m][n];
    }
}
// ```

// In the refactored code, we have added comments to describe the purpose and functionality of each method. We have also introduced a memoization technique to avoid redundant calculations by storing the results of previously computed subproblems in the memo array. This optimization improves the performance of the code.
