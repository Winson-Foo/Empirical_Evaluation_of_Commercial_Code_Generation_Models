// To improve the maintainability of the codebase, we can make the following changes:

// 1. Add proper comments and documentation:
//    - Explain the purpose of the code and the functionality it provides.
//    - Add comments to each method explaining what it does and what each parameter represents.

// 2. Use more descriptive variable names:
//    - Use meaningful names for variables and parameters that indicate their purpose or the data they hold.

// 3. Use a more modular approach:
//    - Break down the code into smaller, reusable methods to improve readability and maintainability.
//    - Separate the recursive logic from the main method to make it more understandable.

// 4. Correct indentation and formatting:
//    - Make sure the code is properly indented and formatted for better readability.

// Here's the refactored code with these improvements:

package java_programs;
import java.util.*;

// Note: This code is just a refactoring of the existing code to improve maintainability. It does not change the functionality or algorithm used to find the longest common subsequence.
