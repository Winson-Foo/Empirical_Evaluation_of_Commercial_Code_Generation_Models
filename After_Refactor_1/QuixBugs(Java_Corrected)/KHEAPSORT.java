To improve the maintainability of the codebase, we can make the following changes:

- Improve variable names to make them more descriptive and meaningful.
- Add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of the code.
- Use proper indentation and formatting to enhance readability.

Here's the refactored code:

```java
package correct_java_programs;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

/**
 * This class contains a method for performing kheapsort.
 * Kheapsort is a variation of heapsort where the first k elements
 * are sorted in ascending order, and the remaining elements are also sorted
 * in ascending order and appended to the already sorted k elements.
 */
public class Kheapsort {

    public static ArrayList<Integer> kheapsort(ArrayList<Integer> arr, int k) {
        // Create a priority queue (heap) to store the k smallest elements
        PriorityQueue<Integer> heap = new PriorityQueue<>();

        // Add the first k elements to the heap
        for (Integer value : arr.subList(0, k)) {
            heap.add(value);
        }

        // Create a list to store the sorted elements
        ArrayList<Integer> output = new ArrayList<>();

        // Sort the remaining elements and append them to the sorted list
        for (Integer value : arr.subList(k, arr.size())) {
            heap.add(value);
            Integer popped = heap.poll();
            output.add(popped);
        }

        // Add the remaining elements from the heap to the sorted list
        while (!heap.isEmpty()) {
            output.add(heap.poll());
        }

        return output;
    }
}
```

By making these changes, the readability and maintainability of the codebase are improved, making it easier to understand and modify in the future.
