Here is the refactored code:

```java
package correct_java_programs;
import java.util.*;

public class POSSIBLE_CHANGE {
    public static int possible_change(int[] coins, int total) {
        if (total == 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        if (total < 0 || coins.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        int first = coins[0];
        int[] rest = Arrays.copyOfRange(coins, 1, coins.length);
        return possible_change(coins, total - first) + possible_change(rest, total);
    }
}
```

To improve the maintainability of this codebase, you can consider the following improvements:

1. Use more descriptive method and variable names:
   - Rename `possible_change` method to something more descriptive like `getPossibleChangeCombinations`.
   - Rename `coins` parameter to `coinDenominations`.
   - Rename `total` parameter to `targetAmount`.
   - Rename `first` variable to `currentCoinDenomination`.
   - Rename `rest` variable to `remainingCoins`.

2. Add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of the code.

3. Separate the code into smaller, more focused methods or classes based on their responsibilities. For example, you can create a separate class for handling coin operations, such as `CoinUtil`, and move the `possible_change` method to that class.

4. Handle invalid inputs and edge cases explicitly. For example, add error handling for negative `total` or empty `coinDenominations`.

5. Consider using more advanced data structures or algorithms for better performance and readability if applicable.
