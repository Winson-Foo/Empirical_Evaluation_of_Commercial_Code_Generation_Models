// To improve the maintainability of this codebase, you can follow the following steps:

// 1. Add proper comments and documentation: Add inline comments to explain the purpose and logic behind each section of the code. This will help future developers understand the code more easily.

// 2. Rename variables and functions: Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables and functions. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand.

// 3. Use constants for magic numbers: Instead of using magic numbers like 0 and 2, define them as constants with meaningful names. This will make the code more maintainable and easier to update in the future.

// 4. Use the `**` operator instead of multiplication: In modern JavaScript, you can use the `**` operator to calculate the power of a number. This will make the code more concise and easier to understand.

// With these improvements, the refactored code will look like this:

// ```javascript
/**
 * Fast Powering Algorithm.
 * Recursive implementation to compute power.
 *
 * Complexity: log(n)
 *
 * @param {number} base - Number that will be raised to the power.
 * @param {number} power - The power that number will be raised to.
 * @return {number}
 */
export default function fastPowering(base, power) {
  // Anything that is raised to the power of zero is 1.
  if (power === 0) {
    return 1;
  }

  // If the power is even...
  // we may recursively redefine the result via twice smaller powers:
  // x^8 = x^4 * x^4.
  if (power % 2 === 0) {
    const halfPower = power / 2;
    const multiplier = fastPowering(base, halfPower);
    return multiplier ** 2;
  }

  // If the power is odd...
  // we may recursively redefine the result via twice smaller powers:
  // x^9 = x^4 * x^4 * x.
  const halfPower = Math.floor(power / 2);
  const multiplier = fastPowering(base, halfPower);
  return multiplier ** 2 * base;
}
// ```

// By following these guidelines, the codebase will be easier to understand, modify, and maintain in the future.
