// To improve the maintainability of the codebase, we can make the following changes:

// 1. Rename variables and comments to be more descriptive and consistent with the code's logic.
// 2. Break down the logic into smaller, reusable functions with clear responsibilities.
// 3. Use meaningful function and parameter names that explain their purpose.
// 4. Add type annotations to improve code readability and maintainability.
// 5. Remove unnecessary comments and simplify the logic where possible.

// Here is the refactored code:

// ```javascript
/**
 * Checks if it is possible to jump to the last index of the array using a greedy approach.
 * @param {number[]} jumpLengths - Array of possible jump lengths.
 * @returns {boolean} - True if it is possible to jump to the last index, false otherwise.
 */
export default function canJump(jumpLengths: number[]): boolean {
  let lastGoodPosition = jumpLengths.length - 1;

  for (let i = jumpLengths.length - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
    const maxCurrentJump = i + jumpLengths[i];
    if (maxCurrentJump >= lastGoodPosition) {
      lastGoodPosition = i;
    }
  }

  return lastGoodPosition === 0;
}
// ```

// By following these guidelines, the codebase becomes more readable, maintainable, and easier to understand for future developers.
