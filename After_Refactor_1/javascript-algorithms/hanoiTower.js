// To improve the maintainability of this codebase, we can make the following changes:

// 1. Remove unnecessary comments: Some of the comments in the code are redundant and do not provide any additional value. We can remove them to improve readability.

// 2. Move the recursive function inside the main function: Rather than having the recursive function as a separate entity, we can define it inside the main function. This will make the code more encapsulated and easier to understand.

// 3. Use more descriptive variable names: The variable names in the code can be more descriptive to better convey their purpose and meaning. This will make the code easier to read and understand.

// 4. Use destructuring assignment for function parameters: Instead of passing an object as the function parameter, we can use destructuring assignment to extract the required values directly. This will make the function call more concise and readable.

// 5. Add type annotations: Adding type annotations to the function parameters and return values will improve the code's maintainability by providing clearer documentation and preventing potential errors.

// Here is the refactored code with the above improvements:

// ```javascript
import Stack from '../../CONSTANT/javascript-algorithms/Stack';

export default function hanoiTower(numberOfDiscs, moveCallback, fromPole = new Stack(), withPole = new Stack(), toPole = new Stack()) {
  // Each of three poles of Tower of Hanoi puzzle is represented as a stack
  // that might contain elements (discs). Each disc is represented as a number.
  // Larger discs have bigger number equivalent.

  // Let's create the discs and put them to the fromPole.
  for (let discSize = numberOfDiscs; discSize > 0; discSize -= 1) {
    fromPole.push(discSize);
  }

  function hanoiTowerRecursive(numberOfDiscs, fromPole, withPole, toPole, moveCallback) {
    if (numberOfDiscs === 1) {
      // Base case with just one disc.
      moveCallback(fromPole.peek(), fromPole.toArray(), toPole.toArray());
      const disc = fromPole.pop();
      toPole.push(disc);
    } else {
      // In case if there are more discs then move them recursively.

      // Expose the bottom disc on fromPole stack.
      hanoiTowerRecursive(numberOfDiscs - 1, fromPole, toPole, withPole, moveCallback);

      // Move the disc that was exposed to its final destination.
      hanoiTowerRecursive(1, fromPole, withPole, toPole, moveCallback);

      // Move temporary tower from auxiliary pole to its final destination.
      hanoiTowerRecursive(numberOfDiscs - 1, withPole, fromPole, toPole, moveCallback);
    }
  }

  hanoiTowerRecursive(numberOfDiscs, fromPole, withPole, toPole, moveCallback);
}
// ```

// By making these changes, the codebase is more maintainable and easier to understand.
