// To improve the maintainability of the codebase, you can follow these steps:

// 1. Use meaningful variable names: Rename `totalStairs` to `numStairs` to make it clear what the variable is representing.

// 2. Separate concerns: Move the memo table outside of the recursive function so that it doesn't get re-initialized with every function call.

// 3. Use a function declaration instead of an arrow function: Replace the arrow function with a function declaration for `getSteps` to improve readability.

// 4. Add comments to explain the code: Include comments to describe the purpose and logic behind each part of the code.

// Here is the refactored code:

// ```javascript
/**
 * Recursive Staircase Problem (Recursive Solution With Memoization).
 *
 * @param {number} numStairs - Number of stairs to climb.
 * @return {number} - Number of ways to climb the staircase.
 */

export default function recursiveStaircaseMEM(numStairs) {
  // Initialize the memo table outside of the recursive function.
  const memo = [];

  /**
   * Recursive function to calculate the number of ways to climb the staircase.
   *
   * @param {number} stairsNum - Number of stairs remaining to climb.
   * @return {number} - Number of ways to climb the remaining stairs.
   */
  function getSteps(stairsNum) {
    if (stairsNum <= 0) {
      // Base case: There is no way to go down or no further steps needed.
      return 0;
    }

    if (stairsNum === 1) {
      // Base case: There is only one way to go to the first step.
      return 1;
    }

    if (stairsNum === 2) {
      // Base case: There are two ways to get to the second step: (1 + 1) or (2).
      return 2;
    }

    // Check if the result for the current number of stairs has been calculated before.
    if (memo[stairsNum]) {
      return memo[stairsNum];
    }

    // Calculate the number of ways to climb the remaining stairs recursively and store the result in the memo table.
    memo[stairsNum] = getSteps(stairsNum - 1) + getSteps(stairsNum - 2);

    return memo[stairsNum];
  }

  // Return the number of ways to climb the requested number of stairs.
  return getSteps(numStairs);
}
// ```

// With these changes, the codebase should be more maintainable and easier to understand and modify in the future.
