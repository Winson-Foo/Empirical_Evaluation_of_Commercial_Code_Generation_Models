// In order to improve the maintainability of this codebase, here are some suggestions:

// 1. Use descriptive variable and function names: The current names like `dd`, `mm`, `yyyy` may not be very intuitive. Use more descriptive names to make the code easier to understand.

// 2. Break down complex expressions: The `DateToDay` method contains a complex expression that calculates the number of days. Break down this expression into smaller, more manageable parts to improve readability and maintainability.

// 3. Add comments to explain the code and algorithms: The existing comments are limited and do not explain the code in detail. Add comments to provide explanations of the logic and algorithms used in the code.

// 4. Handle edge cases and error conditions: The code should handle edge cases and validate the input for errors. Add appropriate checks and error handling to ensure the code functions as expected in all scenarios.

// 5. Organize the code structure: The code should be well-organized with proper indentation and spacing. This can be achieved by following consistent coding standards and formatting conventions.

// Here is the refactored code with these improvements:

/*
    DateDayDifference Method
    ------------------------
    DateDayDifference method calculates the number of days between two dates.

    Algorithm & Explanation : https://ncalculators.com/time-date/date-difference-calculator.htm
*/

// Internal method for checking leap years
const isLeapYear = (year) => {
  if (year % 400 === 0) return true;
  if (year % 100 === 0) return false;
  if (year % 4 === 0) return true;
  return false;
};

// Method to convert date to day
const dateToDay = (day, month, year) => {
  const daysPerYear = 365;
  const leapYearCorrection = 1;
  const nonLeapYearCorrection = 2;
  const leapYearsPerCycle = 4;
  const leapYearsPerCentury = 100;
  const leapYearsPerFourCenturies = 400;

  const yearCorrection = Math.floor((year - 1) / leapYearsPerCycle) - Math.floor((year - 1) / leapYearsPerCentury) + Math.floor((year - 1) / leapYearsPerFourCenturies);
  const monthCorrection = (367 * month - 362) / 12;
  const leapYearDayCorrection = month <= 2 ? 0 : isLeapYear(year) ? -leapYearCorrection : -nonLeapYearCorrection;

  return Math.floor(daysPerYear * (year - 1)) + yearCorrection + day + monthCorrection + leapYearDayCorrection;
};

const dateDayDifference = (date1, date2) => {
  // Check if both input are strings
  if (typeof date1 !== 'string' || typeof date2 !== 'string') {
    throw new TypeError('Arguments are not strings.');
  }

  const [firstDateDay, firstDateMonth, firstDateYear] = date1.split('/').map(Number);
  const [secondDateDay, secondDateMonth, secondDateYear] = date2.split('/').map(Number);

  // Check if both dates are valid
  const isValidDate = (day, month) => (day >= 1 && day <= 31) && (month >= 1 && month <= 12);
  if (!isValidDate(firstDateDay, firstDateMonth) || !isValidDate(secondDateDay, secondDateMonth)) {
    throw new TypeError('Invalid date.');
  }

  return Math.abs(dateToDay(secondDateDay, secondDateMonth, secondDateYear) - dateToDay(firstDateDay, firstDateMonth, firstDateYear));
};

// Example : dateDayDifference('17/08/2002', '10/10/2020') => 6630

export { dateDayDifference };
// ```

// Note: While I have made the suggested improvements, it is important to review and test the refactored code to ensure it meets the specific requirements of your use case.
