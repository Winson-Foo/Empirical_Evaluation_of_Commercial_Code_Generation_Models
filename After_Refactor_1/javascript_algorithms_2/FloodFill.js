// In the refactored code, I made the following changes to improve maintainability:

// 1. Moved the validation of the location to a separate utility function `validateLocation` to improve code readability and reusability.
// 2. Renamed the `breadthFirstSearch` utility function parameter `queue` to `rgbData` to improve clarity and avoid confusion with the `queue` variable used internally.
// 3. Renamed the `breadthFirstFill` utility function parameter `location` to `rgbData` to improve clarity and avoid confusion with the `location` variable used internally.
// 4. Changed the variable naming in the `breadthFirstFill` and `depthFirstFill` utility functions for the current location and the neighbor coordinates to improve clarity.
// 5. Extracted a utility function `isValidLocation` to check if a location is valid, improving code readability and reusability.
// 6. Reordered the parameters of the `depthFirstFill` function to match the order of the others and improve consistency.
// 7. Added comments to provide clear explanations of the purpose and functionality of each function and utility.
