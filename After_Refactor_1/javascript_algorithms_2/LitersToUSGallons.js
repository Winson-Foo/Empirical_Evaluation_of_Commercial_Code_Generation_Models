// There are a few ways to improve the maintainability of this codebase:

// 1. Add comments and documentation: Although the existing code has a brief comment, it would be beneficial to add more detailed comments and documentation to provide clarity and improve maintainability.

// 2. Use meaningful variable names: The parameter name "liters" is already meaningful, but it can be beneficial to use more descriptive variable names throughout the codebase to increase readability and maintainability.

// 3. Add error handling: The existing code assumes that the input will always be a valid number. To improve the maintainability, it is recommended to add error handling code to handle situations where the input is not a valid number.

// 4. Consider using Constants: Instead of using the magic number 3.785411784 directly in the code, it is recommended to define it as a constant and use it in the formula. This makes it easier to update the value in the future if needed.

// Here's the refactored code with the above improvements:

/**
 * Converts liters to US gallons
 * @param {number} liters - Amount of liters to convert to gallons
 * @returns {number} - Equivalent amount in US gallons
 */
const litersToUSGallons = (liters) => {
  const LITERS_TO_US_GALLONS = 3.785411784;
  
  if (typeof liters !== 'number' || isNaN(liters)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid input: liters must be a number');
  }
  
  return liters / LITERS_TO_US_GALLONS;
};

export default litersToUSGallons;
