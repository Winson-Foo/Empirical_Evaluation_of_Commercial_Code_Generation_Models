// To improve the maintainability of the codebase, I would suggest the following refactored code:

// ```java
package java_programs;
import java.util.*;

public class BaseConverter {
    private static final String ALPHABET = "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
    
    public static String toBase(int num, int base) {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        while (num > 0) {
            int remainder = num % base;
            num = num / base;
            result.append(ALPHABET.charAt(remainder));
        }

        return result.reverse().toString();
    }
}
// ```

// Here are the key changes made in the refactored code:

// 1. Renamed the class `TO_BASE` to `BaseConverter` to provide a more meaningful and descriptive name.
// 2. Made the `ALPHABET` string a constant variable to improve code readability and avoid repeated string creation.
// 3. Renamed the method `to_base` to `toBase` to follow the standard camel case naming convention for method names in Java.
// 4. Changed the data type of the `result` variable from `String` to `StringBuilder` to improve performance and memory usage.
// 5. Reversed the order of the characters in the `result` string using the `reverse` method of `StringBuilder` before returning it to get the correct base representation.
