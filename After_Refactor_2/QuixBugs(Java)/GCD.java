// To improve the maintainability of the codebase, we can make the following improvements:

// 1. Add proper comments to explain the purpose and functionality of the code.

// 2. Use meaningful variable and method names to improve code readability.

// 3. Remove unnecessary imports.

// 4. Follow proper code formatting conventions, such as indentation and spacing.

// Here's the refactored code:

// ```java
/*
 * This class calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
 */
public class GCD {

    /**
     * Calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
     *
     * @param number1 the first number
     * @param number2 the second number
     * @return the GCD of the two numbers
     */
    public static int calculateGCD(int number1, int number2) {
        // Base case: if the second number is 0, return the first number
        if (number2 == 0) {
            return number1;
        } else {
            // Recursive case: calculate GCD using modulo operator
            return calculateGCD(number1 % number2, number2);
        }
    }
}
// ```

// By making these changes, the code becomes more maintainable and easier to understand and modify in the future.
