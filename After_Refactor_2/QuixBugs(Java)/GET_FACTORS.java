// To improve the maintainability of the codebase, we can make the following changes:

// 1. Use more descriptive variable names: Variable names like "n" and "max" are not very descriptive. Instead, we can use names that convey their purpose, such as "number" and "limit".

// 2. Use better indentation and spacing: Proper indentation and spacing can make the code more readable. Consistent indentation helps in understanding the control flow of the code.

// 3. Add comments to clarify the code: Comments can help in understanding the purpose of different parts of the code and make it easier for others to maintain it. Adding comments can also remind us of the logic behind the code when we revisit it later.

// 4. Use a more intuitive return statement: The current use of a new ArrayList to represent an empty list is not very clear. Instead, we can use the emptyList method from the Collections class, which returns an immutable empty list.

// Here is the refactored code with the suggested improvements:

package java_programs;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

public class GET_FACTORS {
    // Returns a list of factors of the given number
    public static List<Integer> getFactors(int number) {
        if (number == 1) {
            return Collections.emptyList();
        }
        
        int limit = (int) (Math.sqrt(number) + 1.0);
        
        for (int i = 2; i < limit; i++) {
            if (number % i == 0) {
                List<Integer> factors = new ArrayList<>();
                factors.add(i);
                factors.addAll(getFactors(number / i));
                return factors;
            }
        }
        
        return Collections.emptyList();
    }
}
