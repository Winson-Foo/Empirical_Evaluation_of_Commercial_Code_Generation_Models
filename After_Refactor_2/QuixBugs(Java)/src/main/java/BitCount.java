// To improve the maintainability of the codebase, you can implement the following changes:

// 1. Add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of the code.

// 2. Follow proper naming conventions for class and method names. Class names should be in CamelCase and method names should be in lowercase with meaningful names.

// 3. Extract the logic into a separate method to improve readability and enable code reuse.

// 4. Remove unnecessary comments that do not add any value to the code.

// Here is the refactored code:

package java_programs;

public class BitCount {
    /**
     * Counts the number of set bits in a given integer.
     *
     * @param num The number to count the set bits.
     * @return The count of set bits in the given number.
     */
    public static int countSetBits(int num) {
        int count = 0;
        while (num != 0) {
            num = (num ^ (num - 1));
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}


// By making these changes, the codebase becomes more readable, maintainable, and follows best practices.
