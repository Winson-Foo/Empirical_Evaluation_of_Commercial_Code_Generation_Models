// Here is the refactored code that improves the maintainability:

package java_programs;

public class BitCountCalculator {
    public static int countBits(int number) {
        int count = 0;
        while (number != 0) {
            number = (number ^ (number - 1));
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}

// In this refactored code, I have made the following changes to improve maintainability:

// 1. Renamed the class from "BITCOUNT" to "BitCountCalculator" to follow the standard Java naming conventions and make the class name more meaningful.

// 2. Renamed the method from "bitcount" to "countBits" to follow the standard Java naming conventions and make the method name more descriptive.

// 3. Changed the parameter name from "n" to "number" to make it more descriptive.

// By following these naming conventions and making the names more descriptive, the code becomes more readable and easier to understand and maintain.
