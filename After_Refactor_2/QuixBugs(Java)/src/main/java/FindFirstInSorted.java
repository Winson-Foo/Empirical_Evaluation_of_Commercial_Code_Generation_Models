// To improve the maintainability of this codebase, you can make the following changes:

// 1. Include meaningful variable and method names: Rename variables and methods to accurately reflect their purpose. This will make the code easier to understand and maintain.

// 2. Use comments: Add comments to explain the logic and purpose of different sections of code. This will make it easier for other developers (including yourself in the future) to understand the code.

// 3. Add error handling: Currently, the code only returns -1 if the element is not found. Consider adding additional error handling to handle different scenarios, such as if the input array is null or empty.

// 4. Format the code properly: Use consistent indentation and spacing to improve the readability of the code.

// Here's an example of how the refactored code may look:

package correct_java_programs;

public class FindFirstInSorted {

    /**
     * Returns the index of the first occurrence of a target element in a sorted array.
     * If the element is not found, returns -1.
     * 
     * @param arr the sorted array to search
     * @param target the target element to find
     * @return the index of the first occurrence of the target element, or -1 if not found
     */
    public static int findFirstInSorted(int[] arr, int target) {
        if (arr == null || arr.length == 0) {
            return -1; // Handle empty or null array
        }
        
        int low = 0;
        int high = arr.length - 1;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2; // Use floor division to find the middle index

            if (target == arr[mid] && (mid == 0 || target != arr[mid-1])) {
                return mid;
            } else if (target <= arr[mid]) {
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }
}
// Note: I have made a few assumptions in the refactored code. I assumed that the array is sorted in ascending order and that the input array and target element are of type int. Please adjust accordingly based on your specific requirements.
