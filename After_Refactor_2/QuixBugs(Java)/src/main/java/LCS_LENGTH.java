// To improve the maintainability of the codebase, we can make several changes:

// 1. Improve variable names: Rename variables to have more meaningful names that describe their purpose.
// 2. Use consistent indentation: Indent the code consistently to improve readability.
// 3. Remove unnecessary comments: Remove commented out code and comments that don't provide any useful information.
// 4. Reduce nesting: Reduce the level of nesting in loops and conditionals to improve readability.
// 5. Simplify logic: Simplify the logic where possible to make it easier to understand.
// 6. Use appropriate data structures: Use a 2D array instead of a nested hashmap to store the dynamic programming table.

// Here is the refactored code:

// ```java
package java_programs;

import java.util.*;

public class LCS_LENGTH {
    public static int lcs_length(String s, String t) {
        int[][] dp = new int[s.length() + 1][t.length() + 1];

        for (int i = 0; i <= s.length(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= t.length(); j++) {
                if (i == 0 || j == 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = 0;
                } else if (s.charAt(i - 1) == t.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[s.length()][t.length()];
    }
}
// ```

// This refactored code uses a 2D array `dp` to store the lengths of the common subsequence. The outer loop iterates over the characters of `s`, and the inner loop iterates over the characters of `t`. The logic inside the loops checks if the characters are equal or not and updates the `dp` table accordingly.

// This code is more readable, has improved variable naming, uses consistent indentation, and reduces unnecessary complexity. It also uses a simpler and more appropriate data structure, which improves the maintainability of the codebase.
