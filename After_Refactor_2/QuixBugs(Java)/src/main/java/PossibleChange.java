// To improve the maintainability of the codebase, we can refactor it by creating separate methods for different functionalities, adding comments, and following best coding practices. Here is the refactored code:

// ```java
package java_programs;

import java.util.Arrays;

public class PossibleChange {
  
    /**
     * Calculates the total possible change combinations given a set of coins and a total amount.
     *
     * @param coins The set of coins available to make change.
     * @param total The total amount for which change needs to be made.
     * @return The total number of possible change combinations.
     */
    public static int calculatePossibleChange(int[] coins, int total) {
        if (total == 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        if (total < 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        int first = coins[0];
        int[] rest = Arrays.copyOfRange(coins, 1, coins.length);
        
        return calculatePossibleChange(coins, total - first) + calculatePossibleChange(rest, total);
    }
}
// ```

// In the refactored code:
// - The class name is changed to "PossibleChange" to follow the standard Java naming convention.
// - The method name is changed to "calculatePossibleChange" to provide a clear and meaningful description of its functionality.
// - A comment is added to describe the method's purpose.
// - The method parameters are properly described in the comment.
// - The code is formatted properly to enhance readability.
// - The code now follows standard Java coding conventions and best practices.
