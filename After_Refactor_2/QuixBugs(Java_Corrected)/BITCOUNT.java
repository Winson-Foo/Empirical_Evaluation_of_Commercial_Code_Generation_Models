// To improve the maintainability of the codebase, here are some suggested changes:

// 1. Add proper comments to explain the purpose and logic of the code.
// 2. Use meaningful variable names for better understanding.
// 3. Format the code properly using indentation and spacing.
// 4. Use a more descriptive class name.

// Here's the refactored code with the suggested changes:

// ```
package correct_java_programs;

/*
 * This class provides a method to count the number of set bits in an integer.
 */
public class BitCounter {
    
    /*
     * Counts the number of set bits in an integer.
     *
     * @param number the input integer
     * @return the count of set bits in the input number
     */
    public static int countSetBits(int number) {
        int count = 0;
        
        while (number != 0) {
            number = (number & (number - 1));
            count++;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
// ```
