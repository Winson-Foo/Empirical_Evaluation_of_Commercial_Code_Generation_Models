To improve the maintainability of the codebase, we can make the following changes:

1. Remove unnecessary comments and imports: The comments that mention changing the template and opening the template in the editor are not necessary. Additionally, the import statement for the ArrayList can be removed as it is already included in the code.

2. Improve variable names: The variable names like "arr", "k", "counts", "sorted_arr" can be made more descriptive to improve code readability.

3. Add proper code formatting: The code should be properly indented and aligned to enhance readability.

4. Remove hard-coded values: Instead of hard-coding the initial size of the sorted_arr ArrayList as 100, we can dynamically set it based on the size of the input array.

Here's the refactored code with these improvements:

```java
package correct_java_programs;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;

public class BucketSort {
    public static ArrayList<Integer> bucketSort(ArrayList<Integer> inputArray, int maxValue) {
        ArrayList<Integer> counts = new ArrayList<Integer>(Collections.nCopies(maxValue + 1, 0));

        for (Integer value : inputArray) {
            counts.set(value, counts.get(value) + 1);
        }

        int arraySize = inputArray.size();
        ArrayList<Integer> sortedArray = new ArrayList<Integer>(arraySize);

        for (int i = 0; i < counts.size(); i++) {
            sortedArray.addAll(Collections.nCopies(counts.get(i), i));
        }

        return sortedArray;
    }
}
```

With these improvements, the codebase becomes more maintainable and easier to understand.
