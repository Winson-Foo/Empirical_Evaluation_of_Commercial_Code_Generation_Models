To improve the maintainability of this codebase, we can make the following changes:

1. Give more descriptive names to the variables and methods to improve readability.
2. Add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of the code.
3. Use more appropriate parameter names and eliminate redundant variables.
4. Include error handling for edge cases.

Here is the refactored code:

```java
package correct_java_programs;

public class FindInSorted {
    public static int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target, int start, int end) {
        // Edge case: If the start and end index are the same, the element is not found
        if (start == end) {
            return -1;
        }
        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2; // Floor division to find the mid index

        if (target < arr[mid]) {
            // If the target is less than the middle element, search in the left half of the array
            return binarySearch(arr, target, start, mid);
        } else if (target > arr[mid]) {
            // If the target is greater than the middle element, search in the right half of the array
            return binarySearch(arr, target, mid + 1, end);
        } else {
            // If the target is equal to the middle element, return the index
            return mid;
        }
    }

    public static int findInSorted(int[] arr, int target) {
        // Call the recursive binarySearch method to find the target element in the array
        return binarySearch(arr, target, 0, arr.length);
    }
}
```

By making these changes, the code becomes more readable and easier to understand and maintain.
