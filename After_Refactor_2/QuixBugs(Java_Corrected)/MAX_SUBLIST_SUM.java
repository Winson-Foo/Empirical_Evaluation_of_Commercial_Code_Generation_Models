To improve the maintainability of the codebase, we can follow the SOLID principles and make the code more modular and easier to read. Here is the refactored code:

```java
package correct_java_programs;
import java.util.*;

public class MaxSublistSum {
    public static int maxSublistSum(int[] arr) {
        int maxEndingHere = 0;
        int maxSoFar = 0;

        for (int number : arr) {
            maxEndingHere = Math.max(0, maxEndingHere + number);
            maxSoFar = Math.max(maxSoFar, maxEndingHere);
        }

        return maxSoFar;
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, we have made the following changes:

1. Class name: The class name `MAX_SUBLIST_SUM` has been changed to `MaxSublistSum` to follow Java naming conventions.

2. Variable naming: The variables `max_ending_here` and `max_so_far` have been changed to `maxEndingHere` and `maxSoFar`, respectively, to follow Java naming conventions and improve readability.

3. Method name: The method `max_sublist_sum` has been changed to `maxSublistSum` to follow Java naming conventions.

4. Removed unnecessary comments: The unnecessary comment about changing the template has been removed.

By making these changes, the code is now more readable and easier to maintain.
