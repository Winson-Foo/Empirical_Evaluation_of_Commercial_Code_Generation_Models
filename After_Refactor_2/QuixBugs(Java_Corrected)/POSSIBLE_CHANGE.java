// To improve the maintainability of this codebase, we can make the following changes:

// 1. Rename the class "POSSIBLE_CHANGE" to a more descriptive name, such as "CoinChangeCalculator".

// 2. Rename the method "possible_change" to a more descriptive name, such as "calculatePossibleChange".

// 3. Move the array copy logic to a separate method for reusability.

// 4. Add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of the code.

// Here is the refactored code:

// ```java
package correct_java_programs;

import java.util.Arrays;

public class CoinChangeCalculator {
    public static int calculatePossibleChange(int[] coins, int total) {
        // Base case: if the total is 0, there is only one possible change
        if (total == 0) {
            return 1;
        }

        // Base case: if the total is negative or no coins are available, there is no possible change
        if (total < 0 || coins.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Get the value of the first coin
        int firstCoin = coins[0];

        // Get the remaining coins
        int[] remainingCoins = getRemainingCoins(coins);

        // Recursively calculate the possible change by including and excluding the first coin
        return calculatePossibleChange(coins, total - firstCoin) + calculatePossibleChange(remainingCoins, total);
    }

    private static int[] getRemainingCoins(int[] coins) {
        // Create a new array to store the remaining coins
        int[] remainingCoins = new int[coins.length - 1];

        // Copy the remaining coins into the new array
        System.arraycopy(coins, 1, remainingCoins, 0, coins.length - 1);

        return remainingCoins;
    }
}
// ```

// By following these changes, the code becomes more readable and maintainable, with clearer naming conventions and separation of concerns.
