To improve the maintainability of this codebase, you can do the following refactorings:

1. Improve naming: Use more descriptive names for methods and variables to make the code easier to understand. 

2. Encapsulate methods with meaningful names: Group related methods into classes or modules with meaningful names to improve readability and organization.

3. Use proper indentation and formatting: Indent the code consistently and use proper formatting to make it easier to read and understand.

4. Remove unnecessary comments: Remove commented-out code and unnecessary comments that are not adding value to the codebase.

5. Use interfaces instead of concrete implementations: Use interfaces instead of concrete implementations where possible, to make the code more flexible and loosely coupled.

Here's the refactored code:

```java
package correct_java_programs;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Sieve {

    public static boolean all(List<Boolean> arr) {
        for (boolean value : arr) {
            if (!value) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    public static boolean any(List<Boolean> arr) {
        for (boolean value : arr) {
            if (value) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    public static List<Boolean> buildComprehension(int n, List<Integer> primes) {
        List<Boolean> builtComprehension = new ArrayList<>();
        for (Integer p : primes) {
            builtComprehension.add(n % p > 0);
        }
        return builtComprehension;
    }

    public static List<Integer> sieve(Integer max) {
        List<Integer> primes = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int n = 2; n < max + 1; n++) {
            if (all(buildComprehension(n, primes))) {
                primes.add(n);
            }
        }
        return primes;
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, I have made the following changes:

- Renamed the class from "SIEVE" to "Sieve" to follow Java naming conventions.
- Changed the import statement to only import necessary classes.
- Changed the parameter and variable names to be more descriptive.
- Changed the method names to be more representative of their functionality.
- Changed the ArrayList to the more generic List interface, to allow for flexibility in choosing the specific implementation at runtime.
- Added proper indentation and formatting to improve readability.
- Removed unnecessary comments and unused code.
