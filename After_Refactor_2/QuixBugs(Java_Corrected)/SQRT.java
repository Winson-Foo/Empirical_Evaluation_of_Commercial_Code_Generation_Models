// To improve the maintainability of the codebase, you can do the following:

// 1. Remove unnecessary comments and imports - In this code, the import statement for java.util.* is not used. You can remove it. Also, remove the template comments.

// 2. Add comments to explain the purpose of the code and the variables used.

// 3. Use meaningful variable names - The variable "approx" can be renamed to "approximation" to make it more clear.

// Here's the refactored code with the above improvements:

// ```java
package correct_java_programs;

public class SQRT {
    /**
     * Calculates the square root of a number using the Newton's method.
     * 
     * @param x The number to calculate the square root for.
     * @param epsilon The desired accuracy of the approximation.
     * @return The square root of the given number.
     */
    public static double sqrt(double x, double epsilon) {
        double approximation = x / 2d;
        while (Math.abs(x - approximation * approximation) > epsilon) {
            approximation = 0.5d * (approximation + x / approximation);
        }
        return approximation;
    }
}
// ```

// With these improvements, the codebase is easier to understand and maintain.
