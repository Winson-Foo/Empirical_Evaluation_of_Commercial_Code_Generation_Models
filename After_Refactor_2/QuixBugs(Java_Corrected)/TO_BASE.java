To improve the maintainability of this codebase, we can do the following:

1. Rename the class and method names to be more descriptive.
2. Add comments to explain the purpose of the code.
3. Use meaningful variable names.
4. Add error handling for invalid inputs.
5. Format the code consistently.

Here is the refactored code:

```java
package correct_java_programs;

public class BaseConverter {
    
    public static String convertToBase(int num, int base) {
        if (num < 0 || base < 2 || base > 36) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid input");
        }
        
        String result = "";
        String alphabet = "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
        
        while (num > 0) {
            int remainder = num % base;
            num = num / base;
            result = alphabet.charAt(remainder) + result;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

Note: In the original code, there was no input validation for negative numbers or bases outside the range of 2 to 36. I have added that validation in the refactored code and thrown an `IllegalArgumentException` for such cases.
