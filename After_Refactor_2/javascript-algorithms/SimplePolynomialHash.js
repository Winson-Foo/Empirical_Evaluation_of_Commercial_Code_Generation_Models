// To improve the maintainability of the codebase, we can make the following changes:

// 1. Replace magic numbers with meaningful constants: Instead of using the number 17 directly as the default base, we can define it as a constant with a meaningful name.

// 2. Add comments and documentation: Provide comments and documentation for better code understanding and maintainability.

// 3. Use more descriptive variable names: Replace ambiguous variable names with more descriptive ones to make the code more readable.

// 4. Use a modular approach: Break down the complex functions into smaller, more manageable functions for encapsulation and reusability.

// Here is the refactored code:

// ```javascript
const DEFAULT_BASE = 17;

export default class SimplePolynomialHash {
  /**
   * @param {number} [base] - Base number that is used to create the polynomial.
   */
  constructor(base = DEFAULT_BASE) {
    this.base = base;
  }

  /**
   * Function that creates hash representation of the word.
   *
   * Time complexity: O(word.length).
   *
   * @assumption: This version of the function  doesn't use modulo operator.
   * Thus it may produce number overflows by generating numbers that are
   * bigger than Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER. This function is mentioned here
   * for simplicity and LEARNING reasons.
   *
   * @param {string} word - String that needs to be hashed.
   * @return {number}
   */
  hash(word) {
    let hash = 0;
    for (let charIndex = 0; charIndex < word.length; charIndex += 1) {
      hash += this.charToCode(word[charIndex]) * this.powerOfBase(charIndex);
    }

    return hash;
  }

  /**
   * Function that creates hash representation of the word
   * based on previous word (shifted by one character left) hash value.
   *
   * Recalculates the hash representation of a word so that it isn't
   * necessary to traverse the whole word again.
   *
   * Time complexity: O(1).
   *
   * @assumption: This function doesn't use modulo operator and thus is not safe since
   * it may deal with numbers that are bigger than Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER. This
   * function is mentioned here for simplicity and LEARNING reasons.
   *
   * @param {number} prevHash
   * @param {string} prevWord
   * @param {string} newWord
   * @return {number}
   */
  roll(prevHash, prevWord, newWord) {
    let hash = prevHash;

    const prevCharCodeAt0 = this.charToCode(prevWord[0]);
    const newCharCodeAtLast = this.charToCode(newWord[newWord.length - 1]);

    hash -= prevCharCodeAt0;
    hash /= this.base;
    hash += newCharCodeAtLast * this.powerOfBase(newWord.length - 1);

    return hash;
  }

  /**
   * Helper function to calculate the power of the base.
   *
   * @param {number} exponent - The exponent value.
   * @return {number}
   */
  powerOfBase(exponent) {
    return this.base ** exponent;
  }

  /**
   * Helper function to convert a character to its Unicode code point.
   *
   * @param {string} char - The character.
   * @return {number}
   */
  charToCode(char) {
    return char.charCodeAt(0);
  }
}
// ```

// By following these improvements, the codebase becomes more maintainable, readable, and easier to understand.
