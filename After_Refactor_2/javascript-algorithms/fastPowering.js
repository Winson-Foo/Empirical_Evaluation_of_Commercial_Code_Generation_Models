// To improve the maintainability of the codebase, we can make the following changes:

// 1. Use meaningful variable names: Rename `base` to `number` and `multiplier` to `result` to make their purpose clear.

// 2. Add comments to explain the logic: Add comments to explain the reasoning behind the code and the steps involved in the fast powering algorithm.

// 3. Use Math.floor() consistently: Replace `power / 2` with `Math.floor(power / 2)` in both places to ensure consistent behavior when dividing the power by 2.

// 4. Use consistent indentation: Indent the code using a consistent number of spaces or tabs to improve readability.

// Here is the refactored code:

// ```
/**
 * Fast Powering Algorithm.
 * Recursive implementation to compute power.
 * Complexity: log(n)
 *
 * @param {number} number - Number that will be raised to the power.
 * @param {number} power - The power that number will be raised to.
 * @return {number}
 */
export default function fastPowering(number, power) {
  if (power === 0) {
    // Anything that is raised to the power of zero is 1.
    return 1;
  }

  if (power % 2 === 0) {
    // If the power is even, we may recursively redefine the result via twice smaller powers: 
    // number^8 = number^4 * number^4.
    const result = fastPowering(number, Math.floor(power / 2));
    return result * result;
  }

  // If the power is odd, we may recursively redefine the result via twice smaller powers:
  // number^9 = number^4 * number^4 * number.
  const result = fastPowering(number, Math.floor(power / 2));
  return result * result * number;
}
// ```

// With these changes, the code is now more readable and easier to maintain.
