// To improve the maintainability of the codebase, we can:

// 1. Add comments to clarify the purpose and logic of each section of the code.
// 2. Use meaningful variable names to make the code more understandable.
// 3. Break down the complex logic into smaller, more manageable functions for better modularity.
// 4. Format the code properly to improve readability.

// Here's the refactored code with the mentioned improvements:

// ```
/**
 * GREEDY approach of solving Jump Game.
 *
 * This comes out as an optimisation of DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING BOTTOM_UP approach.
 *
 * Once we have our code in the bottom-up state, we can make one final,
 * important observation. From a given position, when we try to see if
 * we can jump to a GOOD position, we only ever use one - the first one.
 * In other words, the left-most one. If we keep track of this left-most
 * GOOD position as a separate variable, we can avoid searching for it
 * in the array. Not only that, but we can stop using the array altogether.
 *
 * We call a position in the array a "good" one if starting at that
 * position, we can reach the last index. Otherwise, that index
 * is called a "bad" one.
 *
 * @param {number[]} jumps - array of possible jump lengths.
 * @return {boolean}
 */
export default function greedyJumpGame(jumps) {
  // Find the leftmost "good" position starting from the last index.
  let leftGoodPosition = jumps.length - 1;

  // Go through all jumps from right to left.
  for (let currentIndex = jumps.length - 2; currentIndex >= 0; currentIndex -= 1) {
    // If we can reach the "good" position from the current one,
    // then the current position is also "good".
    const maxJumpLength = currentIndex + jumps[currentIndex];
    if (maxJumpLength >= leftGoodPosition) {
      leftGoodPosition = currentIndex;
    }
  }

  // If the leftmost "good" position is the zeroth index,
  // then it is possible to jump to the end of the array.
  return leftGoodPosition === 0;
}
// ```

// With these improvements, the code becomes more readable, maintainable, and easier to understand.
