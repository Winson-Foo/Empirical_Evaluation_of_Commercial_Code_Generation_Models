// To improve the maintainability of the codebase, we can apply the following refactorings:
// - Adding meaningful comments and documentation to improve code readability and understandability.
// - Breaking down the code into smaller, more modular functions with clear responsibilities.
// - Using descriptive variable and function names to enhance code clarity.
// - Following consistent code formatting and indentation for better readability.

// Here is the refactored code:

// ```javascript
/**
 * Checks if a string is a palindrome.
 * @param {string} string - The string to check.
 * @return {boolean} True if the string is a palindrome, false otherwise.
 */
export default function isPalindrome(string) {
  // Initialize left and right pointers
  let leftIndex = 0;
  let rightIndex = string.length - 1;

  // Compare characters from both ends of the string
  while (leftIndex < rightIndex) {
    if (string[leftIndex] !== string[rightIndex]) {
      return false; // Not a palindrome
    }
    leftIndex += 1;
    rightIndex -= 1;
  }

  return true; // It is a palindrome
}
// ```

// By applying these refactorings, we have improved the maintainability of the codebase by making it easier to read, understand, and modify in the future.
