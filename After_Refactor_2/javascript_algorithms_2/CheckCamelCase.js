// To improve the maintainability of the codebase, we can make the following changes:

// 1. Add appropriate comments: Provide comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each section of code.

// 2. Use clear and descriptive variable names: Rename variables to more meaningful names that accurately represent their purpose.

// 3. Extract regex pattern into a separate constant: Move the regex pattern into a separate constant variable to improve code readability.

// 4. Use early returns: Use early returns instead of nested if statements to make the code more readable and reduce complexity.

// 5. Add error handling: Handle the case when the input is not a string by throwing a TypeError.

// Here's the refactored code:

// ```javascript
/**
 * Checks if the given string is in camelCase.
 * @param {String} varName - The name of the variable to check.
 * @returns {Boolean} - Returns true if the string is in camelCase, else returns false.
 * @throws {TypeError} - Throws an error if the input is not a string.
 */
const checkCamelCase = (varName) => {
  if (typeof varName !== 'string') {
    throw new TypeError('Argument is not a string.');
  }

  const regexPattern = /^[a-z][A-Za-z]*$/;

  return regexPattern.test(varName);
};

export { checkCamelCase };
// ```

// By following these improvements, the code becomes more readable, maintainable, and easier to understand and modify in the future.
