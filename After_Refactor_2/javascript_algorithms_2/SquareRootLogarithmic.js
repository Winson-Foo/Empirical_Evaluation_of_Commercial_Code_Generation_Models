// To improve the maintainability of the codebase, we can consider the following refactoring:

// 1. Add meaningful variable names: Replace variable names like `num`, `sqrt`, `edge`, and `mid` with more descriptive names to enhance understanding.

// 2. Use comments to document the code: Provide comments to explain the purpose and logic of important code sections.

// 3. Extract repeated calculations to separate functions: Instead of repeating the calculation for `mid*mid` multiple times, we can abstract it into a separate function.

// 4. Handle edge cases: Add error handling for non-number inputs.

// Here's the refactored code with these improvements:

// ```javascript
/**
 * @function squareRootLogarithmic
 * @description
 * Return the square root of 'number' rounded down
 * to the nearest integer.
 * More info: https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/
 * @param {Number} number - Number whose square root is to be found
 * @returns {Number} - Square root
 * @see [BinarySearch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm)
 * @example
 * const num1 = 4
 * logarithmicSquareRoot(num1) // ====> 2
 * @example
 * const num2 = 8
 * logarithmicSquareRoot(num2) // ====> 2
 *
 */
const squareRootLogarithmic = (number) => {
  if (typeof number !== 'number' || isNaN(number)) {
    throw new Error('Input must be a valid number')
  }
  
  let answer = 0
  let left = 0
  let right = number

  while (left <= right) {
    const middle = Math.trunc((left + right) / 2)
    const square = calculateSquare(middle)

    if (square === number) {
      return middle
    } else if (square < number) {
      answer = middle
      left = middle + 1
    } else {
      right = middle - 1
    }
  }

  return answer
}

const calculateSquare = (number) => {
  return number * number
}

export { squareRootLogarithmic }
// ```

// With these changes, the code becomes more readable, maintains better naming conventions, and handles non-number inputs appropriately.
