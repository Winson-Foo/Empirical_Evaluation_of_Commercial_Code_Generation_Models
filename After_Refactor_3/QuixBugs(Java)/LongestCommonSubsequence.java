// To improve the maintainability of this codebase, we can make the following changes:

// 1. Package and Class Naming: The package and class name should follow the Java naming conventions. Instead of "java_programs", we can use a more meaningful package name. The class name "LONGEST_COMMON_SUBSEQUENCE" should be in camel case.

// 2. Method Name: The method name "longest_common_subsequence" should also be in camel case for better readability.

// 3. Comments: The comments at the top of the file indicate that it is a template, but it is unnecessary and can be removed to improve code readability.

// 4. Formatting: The code formatting can be improved by following consistent indentation and spacing.

// Here is the refactored code:

// ```
package com.example;

public class LongestCommonSubsequence {
    public static String longestCommonSubsequence(String a, String b) {
        if (a.isEmpty() || b.isEmpty()) {
            return "";
        } else if (a.charAt(0) == b.charAt(0)) {
            return a.charAt(0) + longestCommonSubsequence(a.substring(1), b);
        } else {
            String fst = longestCommonSubsequence(a, b.substring(1));
            String snd = longestCommonSubsequence(a.substring(1), b);
            return fst.length() >= snd.length() ? fst : snd;
        }
    }
}
// ```

// By following these improvements, the codebase will be easier to read, understand, and maintain.
