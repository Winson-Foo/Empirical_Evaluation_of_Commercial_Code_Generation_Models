// To improve the maintainability of the codebase, you can follow these steps:

// 1. Improve code readability by adding proper indentation and spacing.
// 2. Add comments to explain the purpose of the code and any complex logic.
// 3. Use meaningful variable and method names to enhance code understanding.
// 4. Break down complex logic into smaller, more manageable functions.
// 5. Apply proper coding conventions to ensure consistency and readability.
// 6. Remove unnecessary comments and code.
// 7. Perform error handling and exception handling to handle possible edge cases.

// Here's the refactored codebase with the above improvements:

package correct_java_programs;
