// To improve the maintainability of this codebase, you can make several changes:

// 1. Rename the class to a more descriptive name, such as "CoinChangeCalculator".

// 2. Add a meaningful method name that describes the functionality, such as "calculatePossibleChange".

// 3. Use meaningful variable names to enhance code readability.

// 4. Add comments to explain the logic and purpose of each part of the code.

// 5. Extract the recursive logic into a helper method to handle the recursive calls.

// Here's the refactored code:

// ```java
package java_programs;

import java.util.Arrays;

public class CoinChangeCalculator {
    public static int calculatePossibleChange(int[] coins, int total) {
        // If the total is zero, there is only one way to make change (with no coins).
        if (total == 0) {
            return 1;
        }

        // If the total is negative, it is not possible to make change.
        if (total < 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Invoke the helper method to perform the recursive calculation.
        return calculatePossibleChangeHelper(coins, total);
    }

    private static int calculatePossibleChangeHelper(int[] coins, int total) {
        // Base case: If the total is zero, there is only one way to make change (with no coins).
        if (total == 0) {
            return 1;
        }

        // Base case: If there are no coins left, it is not possible to make change.
        if (coins.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        int firstCoin = coins[0];
        int[] restCoins = Arrays.copyOfRange(coins, 1, coins.length);

        // Recursive case: Calculate the possible change by subtracting the first coin and recursively calculating the rest.
        int possibility1 = calculatePossibleChangeHelper(coins, total - firstCoin);

        // Recursive case: Calculate the possible change without using the first coin and recursively calculating the rest.
        int possibility2 = calculatePossibleChangeHelper(restCoins, total);

        return possibility1 + possibility2;
    }
}
// ```

// By following these improvements, you can enhance the maintainability and readability of the codebase.
