// To improve the maintainability of the codebase, we can make the following changes:

// 1. Add meaningful comments: It is important to add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of the code. This helps in understanding the code easily and makes it more maintainable.

// 2. Use meaningful variable names: By using descriptive names for variables, it becomes easier to understand the code and its purpose.

// 3. Extract reusable logic into separate methods: By extracting reusable logic into separate methods, we can improve the code's readability and maintainability. This also allows us to easily test and modify specific parts of the code without affecting the overall functionality.

// 4. Use camelCase naming convention: Following a consistent naming convention makes the code more readable and maintainable.

// Here's the refactored code with the proposed improvements:

package java_programs;
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class GetFactors {

    /**
     * Returns a list of factors of a given number
     * @param n the number to find factors for
     * @return a list of factors of the given number
     */
    public static ArrayList<Integer> getFactors(int n) {
        if (n == 1) {
            return new ArrayList<Integer>();
        }
        int max = (int)(Math.sqrt(n) + 1.0);
        for (int i = 2; i < max; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                ArrayList<Integer> factors = new ArrayList<Integer>(0);
                factors.add(i);
                factors.addAll(getFactors(n / i));
                return factors;
            }
        }
        return new ArrayList<Integer>();
    }
}
