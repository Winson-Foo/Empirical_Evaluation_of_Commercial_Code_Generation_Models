// To improve the maintainability of the codebase, we can make the following changes:

// 1. Add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of the code.
// 2. Refactor the code to use meaningful variable names.
// 3. Move the "epsilon" value to a constant variable.
// 4. Format the code using standard conventions.

// Here's the refactored code:

// ```java
package java_programs;

/**
 * This class provides a method to calculate the square root of a number.
 */
public class SQRT {

    private static final double EPSILON = 0.0001;

    /**
     * Calculates the square root of a number with a given approximation epsilon.
     *
     * @param x       the number to calculate the square root of
     * @param epsilon the approximation epsilon
     * @return the square root of the number
     */
    public static double sqrt(double x, double epsilon) {
        double approximation = x / 2d;
        while (Math.abs(x - approximation) > epsilon) {
            approximation = 0.5d * (approximation + x / approximation);
        }
        return approximation;
    }
}
// ```

// By adding comments, using meaningful variable names, and organizing the code, we have improved the maintainability of the codebase.
