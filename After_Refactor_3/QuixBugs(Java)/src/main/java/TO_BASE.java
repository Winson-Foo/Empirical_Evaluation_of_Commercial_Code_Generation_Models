// To improve the maintainability of this codebase, we can make the following changes:

// 1. Add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of the code.
// 2. Rename variables and functions to be more descriptive.
// 3. Extract magic numbers and strings into meaningful constants.
// 4. Format the code consistently with proper indentation and spacing.
// 5. Consider using more meaningful variable names.

// Here's the refactored code:

// ```java
package correct_java_programs;

public class TO_BASE {

    private static final String ALPHABET = "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";

    public static String convertToBase(int number, int base) {
        String result = "";
        while (number > 0) {
            int remainder = number % base;
            number = number / base;
            result = String.valueOf(ALPHABET.charAt(remainder)) + result;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
// ```

// With these improvements, the codebase becomes easier to understand and maintain.
