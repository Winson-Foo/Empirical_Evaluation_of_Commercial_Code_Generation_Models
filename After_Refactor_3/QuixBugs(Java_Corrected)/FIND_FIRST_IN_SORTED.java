To improve the maintainability of the codebase, we can make the following changes:

1. Use meaningful variable names: Rename variables such as 'arr', 'x', 'lo', 'hi', 'mid' to more descriptive names that clarify their purpose and meaning.

2. Add comments: Add comments to explain the logic and purpose of the code at relevant places, making it easier for other developers to understand and maintain the code.

3. Adjust array bounds: In the original code, the initial value of 'hi' is set to arr.length, which causes an out of bounds error when trying to access arr[mid]. To fix this, we should set 'hi' to arr.length - 1.

4. Update the return statement: Instead of returning -1 when the element is not found, it is better to return a more meaningful value, such as -1 or a constant like NOT_FOUND.

Here's the refactored code with these improvements:

package correct_java_programs;
import java.util.*;

    // Constant for element not found

     */
    public static int findFirstInSorted(int[] array, int target) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = array.length - 1;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2; // Floor division

            if (target == array[mid] && (mid == 0 || target != array[mid - 1])) {
                return mid;
            } else if (target <= array[mid]) {
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return NOT_FOUND;
    }
}
