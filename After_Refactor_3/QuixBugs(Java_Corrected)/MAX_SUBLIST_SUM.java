To improve the maintainability of this codebase, we can do the following:

1. Add comments: Add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each section of code. This will make it easier for future developers to understand and modify the code.

2. Use meaningful variable names: Instead of using generic variable names like "arr" and "x", use names that accurately describe the purpose of the variable. This will make the code more readable and self-explanatory.

3. Break down the code into smaller methods: Instead of having all the code in a single method, break it down into smaller methods with specific responsibilities. This will make the code easier to understand and modify.

Here's the refactored code:

```java
package correct_java_programs;
import java.util.*;

public class MaxSublistSum {

    /**
     * Calculates the maximum sublist sum of the given array
     *
     * @param array the input array of integers
     * @return the maximum sublist sum
     */
    public static int calculateMaxSublistSum(int[] array) {
        int maxEndingHere = 0;
        int maxSoFar = 0;

        for (int number : array) {
            maxEndingHere = Math.max(0, maxEndingHere + number);
            maxSoFar = Math.max(maxSoFar, maxEndingHere);
        }

        return maxSoFar;
    }
}
```

By following these improvements, the codebase becomes more readable, maintainable, and easier to understand and modify in the future.
