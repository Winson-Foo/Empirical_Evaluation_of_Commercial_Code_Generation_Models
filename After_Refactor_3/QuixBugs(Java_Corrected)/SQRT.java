To improve the maintainability of the codebase, here are a few suggestions:

1. Add Proper Comments: Add comments to describe the purpose and functionality of the class and methods. This will make it easier for other developers (including future you) to understand the code and make changes if needed.
2. Use Meaningful Variable and Method Names: Use descriptive names for variables and methods to improve readability and make the code self-explanatory.
3. Add Input Validation: Validate the input parameters to ensure they are within acceptable ranges. For example, check if `x` is non-negative and `epsilon` is positive.
4. Extract Constants: Extract any magic numbers or constants used in the code into named variables to improve code readability and maintainability.
5. Organize Imports: Remove unused imports and reorganize the imports to follow a consistent order.

Here's the refactored code implementing these suggestions:

```java
package correct_java_programs;

/**
 * A utility class for performing square root calculations.
 */
public class Sqrt {
    private static final double DEFAULT_EPSILON = 0.0001;

    /**
     * Calculates the square root of a given number.
     * @param x the number to calculate the square root for
     * @return the square root of x
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if x is negative
     */
    public static double sqrt(double x) {
        return sqrt(x, DEFAULT_EPSILON);
    }

    /**
     * Calculates the square root of a given number with a specified epsilon value.
     * @param x the number to calculate the square root for
     * @param epsilon the desired accuracy level (must be positive)
     * @return the square root of x
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if x is negative or epsilon is non-positive
     */
    public static double sqrt(double x, double epsilon) {
        if (x < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Cannot calculate square root of a negative number");
        }
        if (epsilon <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Epsilon must be positive");
        }

        double approx = x / 2d;
        while (Math.abs(x - approx * approx) > epsilon) {
            approx = 0.5d * (approx + x / approx);
        }
        return approx;
    }
}
```

By following these guidelines, the code becomes more readable, easier to understand, and maintainable.
