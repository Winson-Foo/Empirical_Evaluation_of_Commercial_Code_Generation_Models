// To improve the maintainability of the codebase, we can refactor the code by separating the recursive logic into a separate helper function. This will make the code easier to understand and modify if needed. Here's the refactored code:

// ```javascript
/**
 * Fast Powering Algorithm.
 * Recursive implementation to compute power.
 *
 * Complexity: log(n)
 *
 * @param {number} base - Number that will be raised to the power.
 * @param {number} power - The power that number will be raised to.
 * @return {number}
 */
export default function fastPowering(base, power) {
  if (power === 0) {
    // Anything that is raised to the power of zero is 1.
    return 1;
  }

  return fastPower(base, power);

  function fastPower(base, power) {
    if (power === 1) {
      // Base case: power is 1
      return base;
    }

    if (power % 2 === 0) {
      // If the power is even...
      // we may recursively redefine the result via twice smaller powers:
      // x^8 = x^4 * x^4.
      const multiplier = fastPower(base, power / 2);
      return multiplier * multiplier;
    } else {
      // If the power is odd...
      // we may recursively redefine the result via twice smaller powers:
      // x^9 = x^4 * x^4 * x.
      const multiplier = fastPower(base, Math.floor(power / 2));
      return multiplier * multiplier * base;
    }
  }
}
// ```

// In this refactored code, we've introduced a helper function `fastPower` that handles the recursive logic. This function is called within the main `fastPowering` function to compute the power. This separation of concerns makes the code more readable and maintainable.
