// To improve the maintainability of this codebase, we can make the following changes:

// 1. Remove unnecessary comments: Some of the comments in the code are stating the obvious or are not adding much value. We should remove those comments to make the code cleaner and easier to read.

// 2. Use more descriptive variable names: Variable names like `arr`, `strLen`, `perms`, etc. are not very descriptive and make it harder to understand the code. We should use more meaningful names that accurately represent the purpose of the variables.

// 3. Use constants to store fixed values: The value `' '` is used multiple times as a separator while splitting and joining strings. It would be better to define this as a constant and reuse it instead of hardcoding it multiple times.

// Here is the refactored code with these improvements:

// ```javascript
const SPACE_SEPARATOR = ' ';

const createPermutations = (str) => {
  const characters = str.split('');

  const length = characters.length;
  const permutations = [];

  if (length === 0) {
    return [str];
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    const remaining = Object.create(characters);
    const picked = remaining.splice(i, 1);
    const remainingPermutations = createPermutations(remaining.join(''));

    for (let j = 0, jLength = remainingPermutations.length; j < jLength; j++) {
      const next = picked.concat(remainingPermutations[j]);
      permutations.push(next.join(SPACE_SEPARATOR));
    }
  }

  return permutations;
};

export { createPermutations };
// ```

// These changes make the code more readable and maintainable by using descriptive variable names, removing unnecessary comments, and using constants for fixed values.
