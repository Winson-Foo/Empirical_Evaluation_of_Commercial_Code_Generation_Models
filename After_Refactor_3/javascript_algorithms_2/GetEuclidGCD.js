// To improve the maintainability of the codebase, you can consider the following refactored code:

// ```javascript
/**
 * getEuclidGCD - Euclidean algorithm to determine the GCD of two numbers
 * @param {number} a - integer (may be negative)
 * @param {number} b - integer (may be negative)
 * @throws {TypeError} - if arguments are not numbers
 * @returns {number | undefined} - greatest common divisor gcd(a, b)
 */
export function getEuclidGCD(a, b) {
  if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
    throw new TypeError('Arguments must be numbers');
  }

  if (a === 0 && b === 0) {
    return undefined; // Infinitely many numbers divide 0
  }

  a = Math.abs(a);
  b = Math.abs(b);

  while (b !== 0) {
    const remainder = a % b;
    a = b;
    b = remainder;
  }

  return a;
}
// ```

// In the refactored code:
// - The function name `GetEuclidGCD` is changed to `getEuclidGCD` to follow JavaScript's naming conventions. Functions and variables should start with a lowercase letter.
// - The parameter names `a` and `b` are formatted in lowercase for consistency with JavaScript style.
// - Improved comments to clarify the code's functionality and the purpose of certain conditions.
// - The `TypeError` throwing logic is moved outside the while-loop to increase maintainability and readability.
// - The `remainder` variable is used instead of `rem` to improve readability and maintainability.
// - Proper indentation and spacing are applied for better code presentation.

// These changes aim to enhance code maintainability by adhering to common JavaScript coding conventions and improving code readability.
