// To improve the maintainability of the codebase, I would suggest the following refactored code:

// ```javascript
/**
 * This class represents a sphere and can calculate its volume and surface area
 * @constructor
 * @param {number} radius - The radius of the sphere
 * @see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere
 */
export default class Sphere {
  constructor(radius) {
    this.radius = radius;
  }

  volume() {
    return this.calculateVolume();
  }

  surfaceArea() {
    return this.calculateSurfaceArea();
  }

  calculateVolume() {
    return (4 / 3) * Math.PI * Math.pow(this.radius, 3);
  }

  calculateSurfaceArea() {
    return 4 * Math.PI * Math.pow(this.radius, 2);
  }
}
// ```

// In the refactored code, I have separated the calculation of volume and surface area into their own functions (`calculateVolume` and `calculateSurfaceArea`) within the `Sphere` class. This separation allows for better organization and improves maintainability by making it easier to modify or optimize the calculations in the future.

// I have also modified the `volume` and `surfaceArea` methods to call the corresponding calculation functions. This abstraction provides a clear interface for calculating the volume and surface area of the sphere, making the code more readable and understandable.

// Lastly, I removed the arrow function syntax (`volume = () => { ... }`) and replaced it with traditional function syntax (`volume() { ... }`). This change aligns with the standard class syntax and improves compatibility with older browsers or environments that may not support arrow functions.
