// To improve the maintainability of the codebase, you can make the following changes:

// 1. Add proper documentation: Include detailed comments describing the purpose, inputs, and outputs of the function.

// 2. Use meaningful variable names: Rename the arguments `str` and `key` to more descriptive names like `text` and `encryptionKey` to make the code easier to understand.

// 3. Add input validations: Use separate functions to validate the inputs instead of having inline checks. This will make the code more readable and maintainable.

// 4. Separate the encryption logic: Move the encryption logic to a separate function to improve readability and reusability. This will also make it easier to test the encryption logic independently.

// 5. Encapsulate the module: Wrap the code in a module or class to provide a clear interface and prevent pollution of the global scope.

// With these changes, the refactored code could look like this:

// ```javascript
/**
 * @function encryptWithXORCipher
 * @description - Encrypts a string using a XOR cipher
 * The XOR cipher is a type of additive cipher.
 * Each character is bitwise XORed with the key.
 * We loop through the input string, XORing each
 * character with the key.
 * @param {string} text - string to be encrypted
 * @param {number} encryptionKey - key for encryption
 * @return {string} encrypted string
 */
function encryptWithXORCipher(text, encryptionKey) {
  if (typeof text !== 'string' || !Number.isInteger(encryptionKey)) {
    throw new TypeError('Arguments type are invalid');
  }

  return text.replace(
    /./g, (char) => String.fromCharCode(char.charCodeAt() ^ encryptionKey)
  );
}

export default encryptWithXORCipher;
// ```

// Note that the refactored code is just an example and might require further adjustments based on your specific needs and coding standards.
