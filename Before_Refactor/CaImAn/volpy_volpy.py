    """ Spike Detection in Voltage Imaging
        The general file class which is used to find spikes of voltage imaging.
        Its architecture is similar to the one of scikit-learn calling the function fit
        to run everything which is part of the structure of the class.
        The output will be recorded in self.estimates.
        In order to use VolPy within CaImAn, you must install Keras into your conda environment. 
        You can do this by activating your environment, and then issuing the command 
        "conda install -c conda-forge keras".
