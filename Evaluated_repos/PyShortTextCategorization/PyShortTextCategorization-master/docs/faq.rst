Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
================================

**Q1. Can we use TensorFlow backend?**

Ans: Yes, users can use TensorFlow and CNTK backend instead of Theano backend. Refer to `Keras Backend
<https://keras.io/backend/>`_ for information about switching backends.


**Q2. Can we use word-embedding algorithms other than Word2Vec?**

Ans: Yes. Besides Word2Vec, you can use FastText and PoincarÃ© embedding. See: :doc:`tutorial_wordembed` .


**Q3. Can this package work on Python 3?**

Ans: Since release 1.0.0, this package can be run in Python 2.7, 3.5, and 3.6. (Before that, it operates only under Python 2.7.)
     Since release 1.0.7, this package can also be run in Python 3.7 as well.


**Q4. Warning or messages pop up when running models involving neural networks. What is the problem?**

Ans: Make sure your `keras` have version >= 2.



**Q5. How should I cite `shorttext` if I use it in my research?**

Ans: For the time being, You do not have to cite a particular paper for using this package.
However, if you use any particular functions or class, check out the docstring. If there is a paper (or papers)
mentioned, cite those papers. For example, if you use `CNNWordEmbed` in `frameworks
<https://github.com/stephenhky/PyShortTextCategorization/blob/master/shorttext/classifiers/embed/nnlib/frameworks.py>`_,
according to the docstring, cite Yoon Kim's paper. Refer to this documentation for the reference too.


**Q6. Is there any reasons why word-embedding keras layers no longer used since release 0.5.11?**

Ans: This functionality is removed since release 0.5.11, due to the following reasons:

* `keras` changed its code that produces this bug;
* the layer is consuming memory;
* only Word2Vec is supported; and
* the results are incorrect.


**Q7. I am having trouble in install `shorttext` on Google Cloud Platform. What should I do?**

Ans: There is no "Python.h". Run: `sudo apt-get install python3-dev` in SSH shell of the VM instance.
