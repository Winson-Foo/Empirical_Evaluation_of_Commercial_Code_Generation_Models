Gensim Incubator
----------------

Chinmaya Pancholi, a student in Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, is supported
by Google Summer of Code (GSoC) project to support the open-source project for `gensim`.
Part of his project is to employ the wrapping ideas in `shorttext` to integrate `keras`,
`scikit-learn` and `gensim`.
