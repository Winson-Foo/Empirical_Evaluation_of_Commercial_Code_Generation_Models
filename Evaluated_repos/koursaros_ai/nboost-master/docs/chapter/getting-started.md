### Setting up a Neural Proxy for Elasticsearch in 3 minutes

In this example we will set up a proxy to sit in between the client and Elasticsearch and boost the results!

#### Installing NBoost with tensorflow

If you want to run the example on a GPU, make sure you have Tensorflow 1.14-1.15 (with CUDA) to support the modeling functionality. However, if you want to just run it on a CPU, don't worry about it. For both cases, just run:

```bash
pip install nboost[tf]
```


#### Setting up an Elasticsearch Server
> ðŸ”” If you already have an Elasticsearch server, you can skip this step!

If you don't have Elasticsearch, not to worry! You can set up a local Elasticsearch cluster by using docker. First, get the ES image by running:
```bash
docker pull elasticsearch:7.4.2
```
Once you have the image, you can run an Elasticsearch server via:
```bash
docker run -d -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" elasticsearch:7.4.2
```

#### Deploying the proxy
Now we're ready to deploy our Neural Proxy! It is very simple to do this, simply run:
```bash
nboost --uport 9200
```
> ðŸ“¢ The `--uhost` and `--uport` should be the same as the Elasticsearch server above! Uhost and uport are short for upstream-host and upstream-port (referring to the upstream server).

If you get this message: `Listening: <host>:<port>`, then we're good to go!

#### Indexing some data
NBoost has a handy indexing tool built in (`nboost-index`). For demonstration purposes,  will be indexing [a set of passages about traveling and hotels](https://microsoft.github.io/TREC-2019-Deep-Learning/) through NBoost. You can add the index to your Elasticsearch server by running:
>  `travel.csv` comes with NBoost
```bash
nboost-index --file travel.csv --name travel --delim ,
```` 


Now let's test it out! Hit the Elasticsearch with:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/travel/_search?pretty&q=passage:vegas&size=2"
```

If the Elasticsearch result has the `_nboost` tag in it, congratulations it's working!

#### What just happened?
Let's check out the **NBoost frontend**. Go to your browser and visit [localhost:8000/nboost](http://localhost:8000/nboost).
> If you don't have access to a browser, you can `curl http://localhost:8000/nboost/status` for the same information.

</p>

The frontend recorded everything that happened:

1. NBoost got a request for **2 search results**. *(0.32 ms)*
2. NBoost connected to the server. *(0.13 ms)*
3. NBoost sent a request for 10 search results to the server. *(0.12 ms)* 
4. NBoost received **10 search results** from the server. *(120.33 ms)*
5. The model picked the best 2 search results. *(300 ms)*
6. NBoost returned the search results to the client. *(0.10 ms)* 

#### Elastic made easy
To increase the number of parallel proxies, simply increase `--workers`. For a more robust deployment approach, you can distribute the proxy via Kubernetes (see below).

### Deploying NBoost via Kubernetes
We can easily deploy NBoost in a Kubernetes cluster using [Helm](https://helm.sh/).

#### Add the NBoost Helm Repo
First we need to register the repo with your Kubernetes cluster.
```bash
helm repo add nboost https://raw.githubusercontent.com/koursaros-ai/nboost/master/charts/
helm repo update
```

#### Deploy some NBoost replicas
Let's try deploying four replicas:
```bash
helm install --name nboost --set replicaCount=4 nboost/nboost
```

All possible `--set` ([values.yaml](https://github.com/koursaros-ai/nboost/blob/master/charts/nboost/values.yaml)) options are listed below:
