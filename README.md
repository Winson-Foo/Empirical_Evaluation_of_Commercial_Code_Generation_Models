# Exploring ChatGPT: Evaluating its Code Generation Prowess for Refactoring Diverse Codebases

This repository contains the automation code, before refactored code from Github, after refactored code from Github and result from SonarCloud(Static Analysis Tools) for our paper: "Exploring ChatGPT: Evaluating its Code Generation Prowess for Refactoring Diverse Codebases"

# Overview

We have provided result of the SonarCloud analysis.
We also provide the refactored code by ChatGPT to generate technical analysis on the code in the paper.
The following figure provide a workflow for the paper
